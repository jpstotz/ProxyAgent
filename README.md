Proxy Agent is a tool that is created to ease the proxy connection setup process between a rooted Android device to a computer that is running a Mitm Proxy.

The goal of Proxy Agent is to enable a seamless proxy setup experience for Mobile Pentesters/Security Researchers, freeing them from the lengthy proxy setup process and Proxy CA Certificate import process, enabling them to spend their time discovering new vulnerabilities instead ðŸ˜Š

Proxy Agent consists of Proxy Agent, an Android Application and Proxy Agent Add-on, a Magisk module.

The Android Application provides the UI for the user and holds most of the functions that are needed to run the tool, while the Magisk module helps move Proxy's CA Certificate from the user store to the system store.

The Magisk module is inspired by [MagiskTrustUserCerts](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts) which provides almost the same function with the Proxy Agent Add-on, albeit with slight modifications. If you have MagiskTrustUserCerts installed in your Magisk, you do not need to install the Proxy Agent Add-on.

Note: Tested on Android 7 (Nexus 6P), Android 10 (Redmi Note 8), and Android 11 (Google Pixel 3XL)

## I have followed the setup, but it still doesn't work?!

1. Try connecting to adb shell on your Android device and do a ping to your computer's IP address that is hosting Proxy
2. Setup the firewall rule in your computer to allow incoming and outgoing traffic at port 8080 (To your Proxy's port)
3. Try to import Mitm Proxy CA Certificate again

## What's next?

1. Plans to make the installation easier
2. Addition of more features like SSL pinning bypass and more..
